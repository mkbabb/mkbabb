### Hi, I'm Mike.

I work as a `systems analyst`/`code monkey 🐵`/`.*` at @TheFridayInstitute |
[The Friday Institute](https://www.fi.ncsu.edu/) 🐺.

My current project(s') focus is on data collection and analysis using front-end and
back-end technologies.

### What I'm using.

#### What I'm experienced with.

-   `*nix`-based machines, primarily Ubuntu and macOS.
-   Python 🐍 in conjunction with various libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, SQLAlchemy,
    etc.
-   GUI-based data manipulation, by way of Tableau 📊 or the Google Suite of tools 📑.
-   Database technologies: MySQL 🐬, SQLite.
-   TypeScript: see a sample of this by our speedtest ⏱app here:
    [`go.ncsu.edu/mbabb`](go.ncsu.edu/mbabb).
-   C++: used for numerical optimization and other performance critical applications.
-   Apache2 + PHP + `.*`; for the server side of things.

#### What I'm learning.

-   Several web-frameworks, primarily `React` and `Vue`.
-   Complier design and optimization 🛠; some of that work can be seen [here]() and
    [here]()
-   Immutable data structure implementations in both Python and C++.
-   Data collection and processing with AWS. Particularly with their Athena, Glue, and Lambda
    services.
-   `node.js`, `nginx`, and other server-related things.
