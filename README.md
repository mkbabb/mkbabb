# Hi, I'm Mike ![image](assets/cube.png)
I'm a data scientist, programmer, and teacher at
[@TheFridayInstitute](https://github.com/TheFridayInstitute) üê∫.

The focus of my current projects is on distributed data collection and the analysis thereof.

I also like math and programming languages. Checkout my
[cube](https://mkbabb.github.io/keyframes.js/) btw.

### What I'm working on
-   Languages and parsers: see my parser combinator, and parser generator, library
    [`parse-that`](https://github.com/mkbabb/parse-that). Implements my meta-grammar
    language, [`BBNF`](https://github.com/mkbabb/bbnf-language-support)
    <img src=assets/bbnf-small.png width=20>.
-   [`keyframes.js`](https://github.com/mkbabb/keyframes.js), a CSS keyframe animation
    library to tween anything. [cubege](https://mkbabb.github.io/keyframes.js/).
-   [`googleapiutils2`](https://github.com/mkbabb/googleapiutils2), a Google API wrapper
    for Python, focused on usability and performance.
-   [`qualtrics-utils`](https://github.com/mkbabb/qualtrics-utils), a Qualtrics API wrapper for Python.
-   Further development of genetic algorithms for usage in partitioning and scheduling
    problems.
-   A multidimensional array library with a focus on readability and pedagogy.
    -   Implements a novel FFT algorithm leveraging this.
